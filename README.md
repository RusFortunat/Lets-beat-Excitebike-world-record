# Lets-beat-Excitebike-world-record

Let's try to teach our Excitebike motocycle rider to beat [the world record](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erNCijFRXoc&ab_channel=AndrewgSpeedruns) by using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

I will be trying to do so using PyTorch, and [this](https://www.makeuseof.com/python-excitebike-homage-create/) python source code for Excitebike.

Yay, let's do it!
