# Let's beat Excitebike world record

Will be trying to teach our Excitebike AI motocycle rider to beat [the world record](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erNCijFRXoc&ab_channel=AndrewgSpeedruns) by using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

I will be using PyTorch, and [this](https://www.makeuseof.com/python-excitebike-homage-create/) python source code for Excitebike for now. Once I get everything up and running, I will try getting the same version of the game as in the video, and compare my AI bot and the guy from the video performances. 

Let's do it (and some silly crap along the way)! :robot: :mechanical_arm:
<br />
<br /> 


Tentative plan:

1. Learn how to add an AI bot player, that will be doing some semi-sensible stuff on its own. 

2. Learn how to store information about all inputs that AI has made in some data base

3. Figure out how to pass the info about AI actions to a neural network, and use reinforcement learning algorithm to find the optimal set of actions that AI has to make to finish the lap as soon as possible.
