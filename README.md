# Lets-beat-Excitebike-world-record

Will be trying to teach our Excitebike motocycle rider to beat [the world record](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erNCijFRXoc&ab_channel=AndrewgSpeedruns) by using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

I will be using PyTorch, and [this](https://www.makeuseof.com/python-excitebike-homage-create/) python source code for Excitebike.

Let's do it! :robot: :mechanical_arm:
(and do some silly crap along the way)
